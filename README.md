A2RCHI is a retrieval-augmented generation framework for research and education teams who need a low-barrier to entry, private, and extensible assistant. The system was first developed at MIT for the SubMIT computing project, and now powers chat, ticketing, and course-support workflows across academia and research organizations.

## Key Capabilities

A2RCHI provides:
- Several data ingestion connectors: Piazza, Slack, Discourse, email, web links, files, JIRA, and Redmine.
- Several interfaces: a chat app, ticketing assistant, email bot, and more.
- Customizable AI pipelines that combine retrieval, LLMs, and tools.
- Support for running or interacting with local and API-based LLMs.
- Modular design that allows custom data sources, LLM backends, and deployment targets.
- Containerized services and CLI utilities for repeatable deployments.
