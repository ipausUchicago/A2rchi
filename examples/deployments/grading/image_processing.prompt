Extract the mathematical content and text from the handwritten solution images.
Convert all equations, expressions, and symbols into MathJax format using \\[ ... \\] delimiters for display math and \\( ... \\) for inline math.
Return ONLY the mathematical content and explanatory text.

IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
- Do not wrap output in code blocks
- Do not include LaTeX document commands like section, subsection, begin, end
- Do not include figure references
- Use only \\[ \\] for display math and \\( \\) for inline math
- Write explanatory text as plain text

Example format:
For one coil at the top:
\\[ B = I R squared \\]

The magnetic field becomes:
\\[ F = m a \\]

Convert each mathematical expression into separate \\[ \\] blocks.
Include all explanatory text as regular text between the math blocks.
Output should be ready to display directly in a web browser with MathJax.
